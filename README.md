# Tesla-Valuation

The file "Tesla Valuation" includes my analysis and valuation of Tesla Inc. 

I have included a range of different models and methods to determine an intrinsic value of Tesla, such as a Discounted Cash Flow analysis, First Chicago Method of Valuation and Relative Valuation.

The financial data of Tesla Inc and other companies used in my 'First Chicago Method of Valuation' is correct as of the date of the latest update to my Valuation spreadsheet. Please verify any and all of the figures using the latest published financial statements by each respective company.

Feel free to contact me with any questions, feedback or criticism.
